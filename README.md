# Polynomial-Regression

Polynomial regression describe the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y using an nth-degree polynomial in x. However, in polynomial regression, we allow for a curve to best fit the data. This can be particularly useful when the relationship between the variables is not linear.

This method allows capturing more complex patterns in the data compared to traditional linear regression.
